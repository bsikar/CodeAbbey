Even after reading: https://www.codeabbey.com/index/wiki/storing-solutions
I am still posting my solutions because I feel that for the 4 points they listed:
1. I still have some projects even though they are small on my github
2. I want to post my homework, practice problems, and other little things that I have coded to look back to if I encounter something similar in my projects and show others what I have done to learn and practice.
3. Regarding employers and company secrets: My ideal company to work for would be open-sourced, but even though that is unlikely to be the case, of course, I would not post any code relating to my work since if it is open-sourced already, it would be on the company's page and if they aren't open sourced then it is not my place to publish their code since it would be an idiotic thing to do especially if I would be breaking any NDA's
4. If others feel the need to cheat, they are only cheating themselves, and it is pointless to stop someone that is not going to try
